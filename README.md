# semantic-notes

semantic-notes is a simple [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme that is
intended to make hugo useful as a personal notebook. I use hugo with
this theme to take notes throughout the day, which I can then easily
reference later.

## Installation & Usage

You may want to fork this repo. Check it out as a submodule in your hugo
project:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:wryfi/semantic-notes themes/semantic-notes
```

Then configure your `config.{yaml|toml}` to use `semantic-notes` as your
theme.
